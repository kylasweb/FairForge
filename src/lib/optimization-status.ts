/**
 * FairForge Performance Optimization Status
 * 
 * Current Status: OPTIONAL FEATURES
 * 
 * The performance optimization files (ai-optimization.ts, server-optimized.ts, performance-monitor.ts)
 * contain advanced features that require additional dependencies:
 * 
 * Required for full optimization:
 * - Redis (for caching and session management)
 * - Socket.IO Redis Adapter (for horizontal scaling)
 * - Compression middleware
 * - Helmet security headers
 * 
 * These features are OPTIONAL and FairForge works perfectly without them.
 * 
 * TO ENABLE PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
 * 1. Install dependencies: npm install
 * 2. Set up Redis server (optional)
 * 3. Configure environment variables in .env
 * 
 * TO DISABLE (if causing issues):
 * 1. Don't import these files in your main application
 * 2. The app will use default Next.js performance features
 * 
 * Current fallback behavior:
 * - Memory cache instead of Redis
 * - Standard Socket.IO without Redis adapter
 * - Basic compression via Next.js
