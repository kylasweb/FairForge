# 🧹 Optional: Clean Up Cloudflare Dependencies

If you decide to deploy to Vercel/Railway instead of Cloudflare, you can optionally remove these dependencies to clean up your package.json:

## Packages to Remove (Optional)

```bash
npm uninstall @cloudflare/next-on-pages wrangler
```

**Files to Delete (Optional):**
- `wrangler.toml` - Cloudflare configuration file

## Keep vs Remove

### ✅ Keep These (Core Dependencies)
- `@socket.io/redis-adapter` - For performance optimization
- `redis`, `ioredis` - For caching features
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - For database
- `compression`, `helmet` - For security & performance

### 🗑️ Can Remove (Cloudflare-specific)
- `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` - Deprecated anyway
- `wrangler` - Only for Cloudflare Workers/Pages
- `@types/redis` - Already deprecated

## Current Status
Your app works perfectly with or without these packages. The optimization files we created handle missing dependencies gracefully.

**No action required** - everything works as-is! 🎯
